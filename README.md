## What is canta?
canta is a CLI to create and manage Python projects and packages, which makes project development easier. 

If you are looking for a special tool to create and develop your Python projects, manage dependencies and release your projects in a standard way, canta can help you.

canta provides you with management tools that can help you do most of the things you need to develop your projects in a specific environment and monitor your work step by step.
## Why canta?
At first, canta was a personal project. I wanted to manage all the tools and tasks I needed to develop a Python project in a specific environment. As always, I searched first and after working with a bunch of tools, unfortunately, I didn't like any of them! That's why I started working to make canta and share it with others.

Honestly, there is no particular reason why you should use canta. Canta is just a program like millions of programs. But I suggest you to try canta and see if it becomes easier to develop your programs after using it. I tried to develop canta according to my personal taste and needs, and this might make you either like canta or not at all. Of course, I have no insistence to change your opinion, but I suggest you, if you like, try to participate in the development of canta and solve your needs.

If you would like to introduce canta to others and if you would like to participate in the project, read here...
